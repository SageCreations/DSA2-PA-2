Experiment 1. 

Display the root and the nodes/letters in its right subtree in 
the BST on one line as a set of letters and not a tree; 


display the nodes in the first half of the array storing the Heap on the next 
line. 


What pattern do you see? 
- The BST displays the same if not more letters than the first half of the heap 
on a more than likely average.


Explain your take on this pattern and how you can or cannot justify
it as a reliable pattern. 
- In most cases I've seen that the BST displays the same amount of 
letters if the root happens to be in the later end of the alphabet.
If the root happens to be about the first 60-70% of the alphabet, 
it is practically guaranteed to bigger than half the heap. I cannot justify 
this pattern being reliable as I have already run into a case 
that breaks mey observation patter with the small pool of 11 words 
I used for test purposes.


Refer to this by Experiment 1 in your report.
